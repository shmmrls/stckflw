CHAPTER 1
THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND
1.1. INTRODUCTION
Grocery management plays a critical role in the management of the grocery stores because it is required to efficiently manage the inventory so that stocks can be available to meet the needs of the consumers, minimize losses, and support consumer needs. Grocery stores deal with a stream of products that need proper tracking at the point of procuring, to the shelf and ultimate selling or discarding. Nonetheless, numerous grocery stores remain in trouble with keeping track of their inventory in real-time, tracking the expiry date, and balancing the stocks with their real-life consumption rates. Such problems have implications on the efficiency of operations in stores since improperly handled inventories may cause overstocking, understocking, and disposal of products that are not necessary.  Since grocery stores form the main point of distribution of food products to households and social communities, inefficiencies in the grocery store lead to the development of larger issues with grocery availability, the reliability of stocks, and the general management of resources.
Current grocery inventory management that grocery stores and food retailers have tried to use is notorious in trying to handle these operations but seldom goes beyond simple listing of items, monitoring stock and reminder capabilities. Although these systems will offer the first aid in terms of monitoring of the availability of products and their expiry dates in stores, these systems are still very dependent on human input as well as regular staff adherence. In the long run, poor usage and staff involvement make them less effective, especially when the system is not actively promoting accountability or participation. Since grocery stores are the main food supply providers to the consumer, these restrictions are not limited to the retail business but also to the end users. The same issue is experienced by consumers who shop their groceries in such stores because once bought, there is a problem with handling them, especially in the case of a shared household or even in a small organization where the responsibility of handling them falls on many people. As a result, grocery management systems, at the retail, as well as consumer levels, have become underutilized or abandoned, which have the potential to enhance inventory accuracy as well as resource efficiency.
The effects of poor grocery management do not commence and end with the case of poor organization, but rather result in spoilage, wastage, and financial loss. The loss of revenue through inefficient inventory management by retailers amounts to about 8 percent of the overall revenue (Boyle, as cited by Tahernia, 2024), and consumers end up contributing to the waste by unplanned and bulk buying, as well as poor management practices (ReFED, 2022). The results indicate that it is not only about the lack of tracking tools but also about the lack of user continuity in the efficient management of grocery inventories, which seems to be a problem.
This has been observed to be true in the behavior of users whereby the user tends to remain consistent and responsible in using the systems when their behavior is reinforced by the use of incentives and recognition. Children are also more ready to engage in activities related to grocery in homes where there are rewards attached to these activities. In co-living situations, healthy competition will make people use available resources fairly, whereas in small enterprises, the appreciation of the performance of staff will lead to better inventory management. Through these observations, the idea of grocery management systems with gamification could enhance engagement and interaction within the market.
To address these issues, the development of StockFlow, as a gamified grocery inventory and consumption tracking system, in which the management of inventory is the central functionality and gamification is the main form of engagement. The system is used to keep a record of the grocery lifecycle by logging of the items, expiry tracking, consumption tracking, and reporting. Digital rewards, progressive displays, group dynamics, and a context-sensitive system of points would encourage people to engage in grocery management processes by utilizing StockFlow. By doing so, the system will enhance the accuracy of inventory, organized consumption planning as well as foster responsible accountability at the household, co-living, and the small business levels.


1.2. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
Managing a grocery is a very important area to retail outlets and households as it allows them to have their goods when they require it, minimize losses and generally help in consumer satisfaction. This process is done by tracking the items involved in buying through the shelf all the way to consumption or disposition and this involves precise monitoring of the stock, expiry, and usage patterns. Most digital tools are still not accessible to small and medium-sized grocery businesses in the Philippines, as they still use manual inventory practices, leading to stock errors, regular out of stock situations, and ineffective operations (Nartea and Barrera, 2024).


The study of local micro, small and medium grocery stores has revealed that there are usually differences in the effectiveness of traditional sourcing, storage and selling methods. Some of the processes, including storage and restocking, are rated higher than other processes, indicating an uneven inventory management and the lack of technological solutions application in the industry (Bacay et al., 2023).
Poor inventory practice also causes huge losses and wastage of food. According to global and local research, improper handling, vague labeling, and poor tracking cause perishable products to go to waste and revenue losses to the retailers, especially during peak seasons (Tahernia, 2024; ReFED, 2022). In addition, the low user engagement and absence of accountability measures can also lower the long-term effectiveness of the provided simple inventory monitoring systems as they do not encourage their regular use (Boecker et al., 2025).
These findings suggest that the solutions have to be discovered, and these will not only assist in maintaining the check on the inventory, but also promote the users to maintain good records and be smart in their consumption. The StockFlow: Gamified Grocery Inventory and Consumption Tracking System was developed in response to the same. It is a system that integrates one of the most important inventory functions, including how items are recorded, tracked in relation to expiration or even devoured, with the aspects of gamification (rewards, points, progressive indicators). By blending realistic inventory management and fun and game interfaces, StockFlow will assist in bringing more individuals to use it, improving its accuracy and encourage responsible grocery consumption at home, in shared accommodations, and in small companies (Seta & Gate, 2026; UCL, 2025).


1.3. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Homes, apartments and small agencies have been struggling with the inability to control stock in their grocery, keeping a check on expiry dates and patterns of consumption. The existing solutions are based on manual techniques and randomised online solutions that are not synchronised in real-time, do not nurture user engagement and do not offer users sufficient incentives to engage actively on a regular basis. An inability to implement a cohesive customer-friendly system leads to perishable products being forgotten, customer behaviors which are reactive and not proactive and low responsibilities among the users. These shortcomings will add to massive food waste, unnecessary fiscal wastages and inaccurate records on inventory.
Main Problem:
The absence of an automated, gamified, multi-faceted, integrated grocery inventory and consumption tracking system with an automated expiry tracking system, real-time inventory management system, and behaviour reinforcement metrics creates the lack of efficiency, a high level of food waste, and poor response to the system by citizens across households, co-living areas, and small companies.


Sub-Problems:
1. Inventory and Expiry Management 
Lost Perishable Items: With disconnected tracking processes, users can have no visibility on the expiry dates and on-hand stock levels and hence can end up throwing away unused items.
Ineffective Inventory records: A lack of a single system is accompanied by incomplete or old records thus making poor purchasing decisions whereby there is impulse buying and purchasing in large quantities without thinking about the actual consumption requirements.
Revenues and Finance Losses: Inefficient inventory translates to about 8 percent revenue loss in the case of retailers and similarity of wastage of money by households due to spoilage and over-buying.
2. Participation and Interaction with users.
Absence of Long-term Motivation: The systems of traditional inventory management do not ensure long-term interest of the users because they do not provide any significant incentives or rewards to participate regularly.
Reduction in System Utilization: The lack of gamified items would cause the inventory to underuse the system eventually due to the fact that the user will consider inventory management more of a boring routine instead of meaningful activity.
3. Tracking and Reinforcing Consumption.
Reactive Shopping Patterns: Due to the lack of systematic consumption analysis, purchases become unplanned, meal planning is not performed efficiently and goods are allowed to expire without being utilized.
Weak Behavioral Incentives: The existing systems are weak in context-sensitive incentive systems that may stimulate responsible consumption behavior in consideration of various user contexts (families, living in common, work places).
1.4. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
1.4.1. GENERAL OBJECTIVES
To create StockFlow: A Gamified Grocery Inventory and Consumption Tracking System incorporating context-sensitive gamification strategies with a detailed inventory approach to eliminate food waste and reduce it, enhance the accuracy of the inventory, and maintain the interest of users in their households, living in co-livestyles, and small businesses.


1.4.2. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
1. To have an overall inventory management system that will be used to track the full lifecycle of the purchased grocery products, including the storage, expiry, consumption, and waste records.
2. Reasons To come up with automated expiry date tracking and notification functionality, which would actively remind the user of perishable items about their expiry dates to avoid food wastage and money loss.
3. To establish a context-sensitive, point-based, gamification model that supports responsible consumer behaviors such as task keeping the inventory, in time, using the items that are near to expiry date, good planning, and reducing wastes.
4. Introducing customized adaptive reward systems based on a variety of user settings: achievement rewarding to children in families, competitive boards to co-residents in small business settings, performance rewarding to workers in large corporations.
5. To increase both the user involvement and long-term engagement with SQL129 application with gamification features (points, badges, levels and leaderboards) transforming the routine grocery management processes to inspiring and fun actions.
6. To assess how well StockFlow can be effectively used to minimize food wastes, enhance inventory precision, and ensure sustained use of the solution by the users via comparative analysis with the conventional grocery management practices.
7. To curb unruly consumption behaviors like purchasing in bulk, impulse purchasing and compulsive shopping through introduction of systematic planning instruments and behavioral reinforcement elements in the grocery management process.
1.5. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
In this research, a gamified grocery inventory and consumption tracking software called StockFlow will be designed and put to the test. It is anticipated that the results would be useful to households, co-living areas, small business owners and employees, communities, and future researchers.


Households and Families. StockFlow is a system that enables family members to effectively manage groceries and minimise food waste by offering an interactive system to manage all aspects of it. Logging the items, monitoring the expiration dates, and using rewards to be an accountable consumer make families better collaborators, teach children about their resources, and cultivate cost-sensitive attitudes to resources that would improve the overall performance of the household.


Co-living Residents. In common residence, StockFlow provides a reasonable and interactive way of handling perishable goods. Gamified point systems and the leaderboard facilitate a sense of collective responsibility, less conflict due to shared resources, and responsible consumption, which results in reduced wastage and saving of costs in co-living settings.


Owners and Employees of Small Business. StockFlow is a program that can be used by a small business operator to keep track of inventory, minimize spoilages as well as employee performance. The use of gamified rewards to manage efficient inventory creates a sense of motivation among the staff, enhances responsibility in the operations, and assists in reducing losses in financial form due to wastage, thereby, supporting business sustainability and profitability.


Local Society and Communities. StockFlow can help address the greater interests of society by making sure people adopt responsible consumption practices. Local food waste reduction in households and small businesses decreases the demand on local systems of waste management and sustainability of food supply chains, as well as developing an environmental consciousness and ethos of resource stewardship in communities.


Future Researchers. This research has some basis to conduct further studies of gamification, behavioral change technology, and sustainable consumption practices. It shows the influence of merging rewards, points and real-time tracking on user activity and responsible use in both home and small-sized commercial settings.


1.6. SCOPE AND DELIMITATION

CHAPTER II
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDY


2.1.1. FOREIGN LITERATURE
The grocery inventories in the shops and households can be managed effectively to minimize food waste. Research indicates that approximately a third of all food that is produced in the world goes to waste annually [1]. One of the primary causes of such an issue is also poor inventory management, where people are not able to record what they possess and when something may go away [2].
Inventory errors in grocery stores and in particular small grocery stores cause inventory shortages such as product expending, and excess inventory that goes to waste [3]. This is found in research that retailers are losing about 8% of their sales due to ineffective inventory control and spoilt goods [4]. This issue occurs in families where families end up consuming 25-30 percent of the food supplies they purchase either because they forget of their existence or they leave them without exhausting them quickly before they go to waste [5].
Inventory management systems have been created to address such issues through digital mechanisms such as barcode scanning and overdue time maintenance [6]. Nevertheless, most individuals abandon the systems after a few days as they are complex or dull to utilize [7]. Research indicates that the inventory systems should be simple, and provide users with good reasons to continue using to ensure the system works effectively [8]. Gamification refers to incorporating game-based attributes (points, badges and leader boards) into non-games to make them enjoyable and involve-able [9]. This has been effective in making individuals alter their behavior and keep motivated in other fields [10].
Included in the studies is a finding that gamified apps can upsurge user engagement by 40-60 per cent as much as compared to the conventional applications since the latter are considered to feel more rewarding [11]. Once individuals gain points or receive the achievements, they have the trust of improvement and achievement, thus they are motivated to proceed further [12]. Gamification has assisted individuals in sustainability initiatives in taking up superior habits. As an illustration, families with gamified power monitoring applications saved 15-20 percent of electricity [13]. In the same manner, health and fitness applications that have a point system aid users to adhere to healthy practices since they love to monitor their progress and reward systems [14].
The various individuals react well to varying groups of rewards. Near rewards and bright illustrations appeal to the child, competition and success among adults, and collaboration give social credit to groups of people [15]. Research indicates that gamification created to satisfy the unique needs of each group of users makes individuals experience increased engagement rates and play the system at a higher regularity [16]. Smart systems that monitor the consumption of people and assist in their planning on what to buy have become effective in waste reduction [17]. The systems are able to calculate the usage habits and forecast what one would require in future [18].
Studies have found out that when individuals trace their grocery purchases, they would cut down wastage by 20-35 percent since they would be familiar with what they use and what goes to waste [19]. Consumption tracking mobile apps empower people to make better purchases by deciding the quantity of purchases and meals to prepare [20].
There are also hi-tech systems that monitor the consumption rates according to the size of the family and eating habits, this enables people to maintain the correct quantity of groceries without wasting the food through over buying [21]. Research established that the use of reminder systems with tracking on consumption raises the likelihood of using expiring goods by 40 percent [22]. Nevertheless, these systems are limited to the fact that people use them. Applications with excessive manual typing are abandoned due to their tediousness in usage [23]. Such systems that implement less complicated solutions such as bar codes scanning or automatic tracking are more likely to be deployed regularly [24].
Grocery management presents a problem in common areas such as dormitories and small businesses in which there is the same use of items by multiple individuals [25]. In the absence of explicit procedures, there usually comes a tussle of whose and whose to the resources and whether to share the same fairly [26].
The digital tools that present all people with what was in the common inventory and who consumed what contribute to creating fairness and diminishing arguments [27]. Studies on households that share indicate that in instances where all individuals can see who used what, the conflicts will fall by 30-45 percent and resources used more effectively [28]. The use of leaderboards and performance tracking in a group fosters healthy competition and holds people more responsible in their actions. Reports indicate that this can augment accountable conduct by 25-40% [29]. Team issues involved in waste minimization at work places have enhanced motivation among the employees and cost savings [30].
To ensure shared systems operate effectively, they must trace the individual efforts as well as group efforts in order to make each member feel accountable and yet a member of team [31]. People will be able to visualize up-to-date information of shared inventory and prevent repurchasing the same goods and incorporate a better consumption strategy [32].
This is because the reasons why consumers make specific shopping and consumption choices assist in developing improved inventory systems [33]. Research findings in psychology have revealed that most individuals tend to buy without planning or thinking of what to do with everything they purchase in one way or the other [34]. Research indicates an individual is more motivated to avoid losing something that she has than to gain something [35]. It implies that the messages that indicate that this item will be out of date in 2 days are more effective than the neutral ones as they remind of how the loss can take place [36]. Individuals are also prone to be oriented towards short term gratification as opposed to long term repercussions, which contribute to impulse purchases, and wastage [37]. The systems that demonstrate users the amount of money they may lose or how much food could be wasted make them make wiser buying choices [38].
Presentation of the choices is a way of changing behavior. Minor details such as having a sustainable choice as default or displaying significant information in an understandable way can lead people to make better decisions without making them change it [39]. These design options are additionally effective on top of the rewards [40]. Experiments on the development of habit have demonstrated that in cases where individuals are rewarded instantaneously when good behaviors are brought out and the behaviors are repeatedly rewarded in the same manner with time, the behaviors end up becoming automatic [41]. It is the reason why the gamified system with immediate feedback can be a good way to establish a long-term sustainable habit.
2.1.2. FOREIGN STUDY
The problem of food waste minimization through gamification has been considered in several studies conducted concerning the reduction of food waste in households and in retail outlets. One of the studies carried out in Sweden created a mobile app named FoodLoop that could give clients points and badges in order to monitor their food stock and intake [1]. Their findings indicated that participants small food waste was 28 percent less in three months than was the case in a control group. In particular, the gamified aspects of it were reported by users to make inventory control easier and enable them to build healthier shopping practices [1].
A different study was conducted in the United Kingdom testing a gamified food management app named "Gander" on 150 households [2]. The app consisted of: expiry dates, recipes that were based on the products at hand and a reward system on waste reduction. By 6 months, the participating households had cut food waste by 31% and reproduced a total of PS200 savings per year in average [2]. The researchers have discovered that household performance comparative leaderboards were especially useful in sustaining long-term engagement [2].
A study at Stanford University was on a gamified grocery tracking system at college dormitories shared by students [3]. The system enabled roommates to record shared grocery and realize some points on a responsible consumption attitude. The outcomes showed a decrease of 35 percent in the number of duplicates purchases and a 40 percent decrease in the amount of wasted food [3]. The competitive aspects and transparent monitoring were found to have minimized the conflicts over common resources reported by the students [3]. In Germany, a detailed study was done to study how a variety of mobile inventory management applications performed in retail and household setting [4]. The study involved the comparison of traditional list-based applications with the comparison of gamified apps among 200 participants. Results revealed that gamified applications were found to retain users at rates 65 percent above in three months, users more frequently opened the app, on average 4.5 times a week doing so versus 1.8 times a week with non gamified applications [4].
In Australia, scholars created and piloted SmartPantry, a mobile application based on barcode reading and expiry notification (tracking grocery items) [5]. It lasted nine months in which the research was conducted in 180 households and established that the families decreased food waste by 26 percent and enhanced inventory accuracy by 42 percent [5]. Automated expiry tracking was another feature that the users especially appreciated as it made it easy to remember the date of purchase by decreasing the amount of mental load [5]. One of the studies carried out at MIT was focused on the effect of mobile grocery applications on consumer purchasing behavior [6]. The study concluded that instead of buying impulsively, the users of inventory tracking applications did so 23% less often and on the contrary, were 35% more likely to make a shopping list, reflecting the actual needs [6]. The research stated that inventory visibility provided in real time assisted users to make more rational buying behaviors [6].
A study on the implementation of gamification on sustainable household behaviors, e.g., grocery management, was carried out in the Netherlands [7]. The research designed a system of points in terms of which families received rewards on garbage reduction, energy and recycling. At the end of more than a year, the amount of food wasted in participating households decreased by 38 percent, and more households said they were more aware of their consumption habits [7]. The children in such families were especially interested in the gamification aspects [7].
A case study was carried out in three countries of Denmark, Norway, and Finland exploring family-based interaction in gamified household management systems [8]. The study encompassed 300 families and discovered that systems involving child-friendly rewards as well as family challenges continued 78% user feedback in 6 months as opposed to 32% with customary management tools [8]. According to the parents, gamification assisted in educating children on the aspects of resource responsibility and family collaboration [8].
Researchers in Japan created EcoFamily, a gamified platform of home management where numerous resources were traced such as groceries, utilities, and waste [9]. A 250 family study established that gamification increased the engagement of the family members in household activities by 52, and enhanced the dialogue on shared duties [9]. The grocery tracking module has reduced food waste by 29% in particular due to the collaborative planning features [9]. The effect of various types of the feedback on food waste reduction was studied at Cornell University [10]. Researchers put three conditions in no feedback, simple numerical feedback, and gamified feedback, which included visual progress skills and rewards. The highest amount of food waste decreased (41%), and the condition was the most effective in the long-term (12 months) with gamification [10].
Italian research investigated the effect of tracing consumption on buying habit among 400 households [11]. Those participants that actively monitored their grocery intake had a 34% lower rate of impulse purchases and had a 27% lower rate of food waste in general [11]. The researchers discovered that visual dashboards that presented consumption patterns proved to be better compared to text-based reports that encouraged behavioral change [11]. In Canada, a longitudinal study examined the topic of habit formation in grocery management by tracking it with a gamified system [12]. In 18 months the researchers found that participants who tested the gamification items three months or more developed lasting habits that remained even after depression levels of gamification rewards were decreased [12]. It implies that gamification can be used as an agent of the long-term behavioral change [12].
A study was also conducted at the University of Washington of grocery management within co-living settings like student housing and shared costly flats [13]. The experiment had presented a collaborative checklist model that has personal responsibility and unit scoring records. Findings indicated that there was an increase in shared food, a 44% decrease in duplicate purchases, and a 37% decrease in food waste in 25 shared households [13]. The participants indicated that open monitoring minimized the scope of conflicts and enhanced equitable resource distribution [13].
In Singapore, a study was conducted to investigate gamified resource management in university dorms through 500 students [14]. Through the system, residents were able to monitor common groceries, shop, and gain reward due to responsible eating. The adoption resulted in the diminishment of food waste by 48 percent and resource related conflict by 53 percent between roommates [14]. Students appreciated the live access to inventory that was shared and the accountability options [14]. The study of social interactions in the shared housing schemes in Berlin has examined the science of cooperative grocery management [15]. The researchers concluded that gamified systems having individual and team objectives provided a sense of shared responsibility and also individual responsibility [15]. There was a reduction of 35 percent food waste in shared living environments that used the gamified system and the reported satisfaction with the common living conditions was also increased [15].
2.1.3. LOCAL LITERATURE
The research done by Tiauzon, Gemelo, Blancia, and Soberano (2025) was based on the necessity of digitalizing the functioning of the grocery stores, which could help to optimize inventory management and transactions between the customer and the store. The researchers used the post study system to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of the proposed grocery management system involving developmental and descriptive research methods and then the Post-Study System usability questionnaire (PSSUQ) and functional test cases. The results showed that the system gained 100 per cent functionality rating and was rated to be very acceptable in its usability, quality of information, quality of interface and overall system performance by the store owners, customers and the IT professionals. The findings indicate that mobile and web systems may be useful in facilitating inventory and operational management in grocery stores. The authors also highlighted that structured system development and user-centered design play a critical role in the reliability and satisfaction of the users of a system. The proposed research is applicable to StockFlow: A Gamified Grocery Inventory and Consumption Tracking System, since it confirms the usefulness of digital grocery inventory-related solutions in the Philippine setting and identifies the possibility to advance the user experience by integrating the gamification mechanisms.
Mateo et al. (2024) investigated the implications of the digital transformation adoption on the functioning of grocery stores in Occidental Mindoro, San Jose. The quantitative research design was applied, and a survey methodology was employed to gather data on the operators and staff of grocery stores to establish the levels of digital transformation regarding product management, manpower skills, customer engagement, and market analysis. In order to examine the correlation between the digital transformation adoption and the operations of the grocery stores, the researchers used the correlation analysis. The findings pointed to the fact that the digital transformation is a positive and significant factor when it comes to inventory management, marketing efficiency, supply chain optimization, and the overall performance of operations. It was also demonstrated that the relationship between greater use of digital transformation and the subsequent enhancement of business adaptability and operation efficiency is moderately positive.
In the article, Gamboa (2023) authored about the transformation of grocery shopping in the Philippines due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains disruption, and price increase alongside the emergence of digital technologies, the changes experienced a significant alteration. The article identified a tendency towards Filipino consumers gradually moving online to grocery shopping, forcing the supermarkets and grocery stores to broaden their digital service offerings, through the service of online shopping and third-party formation application. The more sensitive the consumers were to price, as it was observed, the more the change in the behavior of buying, the change to the house brands, the shopping in the warehouse, and the pre-ordering the basic goods. In addition, the article pointed to the greater use of grocery apps that are convenient, offer discounts, and offer customers customized shopping platforms that have changed how customers interact and manage inventory. The discussion has also stated that emerging technological changes like scan and go systems and artificial intelligence tools are already beginning to turn the operations of grocery stores around despite the problems that will be encountered with the systems like abuse and theft. This article is relevant to StockFlow: A Gamified Groceries Inventory and Consumption Tracking System since it shows the local data of the increased use of online groceries and stresses the importance of having systems that contribute to the feeling of user responsibility, interaction, and efficient organization of inventory in digital formats by introducing interactive and user-friendly features such as gamification.
The article by Grand Tech International Enterprises Corporation (2022) addressed the issue of the use of point-of-sale (POS) systems to resolve operational challenges that small and large grocery stores in the Philippines are experiencing. The article employed a descriptive method of explicating the general problems that grocer store owners face which included shoplifting, loss of inventory, long queues at the checkouts desk, spoilt products and under staffing. It also analyzed how the implementation of the new POS systems can address such issues with functionality like real-time inventory management, better transaction processing, improved theft prevention, and automated reporting. It was highlighted that POS systems contribute to an efficient operation of the company in terms of inventory control and accelerated checkout, as well as providing the company with a chance to guarantee a high customer experience with the self-checkout opportunities. In the article, there was also the emphasis on the significance of technological progress in the need to adjust to the evolving consumer needs and competitive retailing conditions. Comprehensively, the source emphasized that the application of the POS systems would help grocery stores enhance accuracy, security as well as efficiency thus facilitating sustainable business practices in the retail industry.
Abelardo (2023) covered the problems and good practices on how to roll out a warehouse and inventory management system of the grocery stores in the Philippines, especially in the summer period when the demand of consumers is high. This paper utilized both descriptive and analytic style in the description of the impact of the seasonal demand spikes in the consumption of goods like drinks and snacks on warehouse operations and inventory management. The discussion has highlighted the need to implement efficient logistics practices and collaborate with responsible service providers to make sure the stock is replenished on time and avoids damages to the product. Also, the article highlighted the importance of technology based inventory systems in enhancing demand prediction, regular auditing of inventory, efficient use of warehouse space and proper stock levels. The results indicate that the implementation of the warehouse and inventory control systems along with the advanced logistics solutions improves the efficiency of the operations, minimises the stockouts and overstocking, and promotes the sustainable operation of the grocery store. In general, the article suggests that the key to seasonal demand fluctuations and the performance of the grocery stores in the Philippine retail industry is the effective warehouse and inventory management facilitated by technology and stable logistic partnering.


2.1.4. LOCAL STUDY
Explored in their study, The role of the inventory management services in supplying small and medium enterprises in Calamba, Laguna, (Sanico, Arguelles, and Melicio, 2023), are the essential issues of inventory management in the local business environment. The research established that issues like poor forecasting, stock wastage and damages of goods on products caused huge financial losses to the business. The researchers suggest such professional services as inventory audits and consulting to overcome these problems. The results highlighted that systematic inventory management solutions may assist the SMEs in maximizing their resources, minimizing costs, and enhancing decision-making. The former suggests that, systematically, expert-based intervention is capable of controlling inventory inefficiencies and this is in line with the requirement of systematic solutions that is evident in the current gamified system.
Manual record-keeping and unchangeable reorder levels, as discovered by Nadores, Gabriel, Pascua, Villanueva, Kim, and Sazarta (2026) in their research, Assessment of Inventory Management on Stock-Flow at Corys Grocery Store, were serious barriers to stock flow and operational efficiency to the small local retailer. The use of old-fashioned procedures resulted in regular cases of stockouts, overstocking, and losses. Although the study conclusively showed that the well-developed inventory practices had a direct positive effect on product movement, the problem of inaccurate records and low turnaround time when restocking products was identified, which signified a serious weakness of the current system used in the store. The given finding is a good indication that a structured, updated, and modernized inventory system is on top of the priority list, which is in line with the core objective of the proposed gamified system to substitute the ineffective manual mode with precise and interactive digital one.
In the article, Designing an Inventory Management System for Convenience Store X Using a Design Thinking Approach (Laping, Mendoza, Tiuentino, Villaraza, Bucu and Ngo 2023), the authors have investigated the inventory management challenges of the convenience store in the location of Marikina City, Philippines and developed a digital system that prioritizes the user to address these challenges. They realized that perishable goods were a major cause of pain when it came to tracking stock and spoilage, and used design thinking to understand pain points, which they designed system requirements, prototyped their solutions, and user acceptance tests. They as well employed Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to teach the system design and found out that a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based inventory system would be the most valuable of the models. Their findings confirm why real-time and accurate inventory monitoring tools are needed in the Philippine retailing organizations to reduce the losses and maximize the functionality
In their article, Impact of Inventory Management on Financial Performance of MSMEs in Santiago City, Gaoat, Cabungcal, Enriques, Medios, et al. (2023) showed that the effective inventory practices have a strong positive relationship with operational efficiency and moderate positive relationship with the financial performance of local micro, small, and medium enterprises. The study established that efficient inventory management is pivotal in ensuring good financial health, and such actionable insights can be obtained by owners and managers to improve on the situation. The conclusions, however, also highlighted the fact that to benefit financial results maximum inventory management is not possible by simple inventory management, indicating that there is a disconnect between skilled management and optimum results. This specific finding is a strong signal to the need to have progressive and interactive systems that do not only monitor the inventory but rather proactively improve the process of decision making and operational discipline, which is the essence of the proposed gamified system to transform the routine practices into long term, high performance habits.


According to the research conducted by Gabriel (2025) on the article titled Inventory Management Practices of Retailers in Santiago City, small retailers had moderate to significant problems with the system of manual record-keeping, the lack of shelves, and the absence of formal knowledge in bookkeeping. The study established that storage, issuance, and daily transaction logging practices were not applied in a consistent manner hence lacked operational efficiency and inventory inaccuracy. Although the purchasing operations were often carried out with a focus on the reliability of suppliers, the entire system lacked any documentation and real-time tracking. The given discovery points to the need of structured, user-friendly inventory systems that would balance out the lack of knowledge and would convert the irregular manual practices into the consistent, smooth processes, which is the gap that the proposed gamified system should be closing through the incorporation of user-friendly features that would be engaging in addition to intuitive tracking.


2.1.5. SYNTHESIS
The foreign literature focuses on features such as gamification and responsibility in grocery management. Research focuses on ensuring rewards, points, and progress tracking needs to be meaningful, context-sensitive and user-friendly such that an individual does not get bogged down in inventory work (Boecker et al., 2025; Seta and Gate, 2026). They also observe that social and collaborative aspects assist in instilling a sense of responsibility, trust, as well as motivation among users, which is important in ensuring constant involvement in non-game activities such as monitoring groceries and eliminating wastes. 
These results can be also justified by local research, which indicates that including gamified elements in home or small business systems will increase the level of participation, responsibility, and sustainable behavior (Tahernia, 2024; ReFED, 2022). Specifically, visible point systems, recognizable reward systems, and fair participation policies will help keep the user loyal to the game, which enhances the accuracy of the inventory and reduces the amount of waste. Such studies imply that when gamification is balanced in terms of fun and its real-world value, and the system is simple to comprehend, fair, and incentivizing to all, then the gamification method proves to be the most effective.
 To sum up, it can be stated that the literature presupposes the involvement of gamification, collective aspects, and recognizing reward systems to make grocery management more interesting, accountable, and productive. The following lessons inform the creation of StockFlow: A Gamified Grocery Inventory and Consumption Tracking System, the combination of grocery inventory tracking with an interactive gamified experience that encourages the use of a sustainable amount of resources, proper management of stocks, and long-term engagement and participation at the household, co-living, and small business level.
